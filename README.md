# Hello-Recipe
A simple Python program that greets the user by name and shows a pasta recipe (or tells if it’s unavailable).

## Problem Statement
I wanted to build a small program that feels like talking to a friendly chef.  
The program should ask for your name, then ask what recipe you want.  
If it's pasta, it should show the steps. If not, it should say it’s unavailable.

## How I Thought About It
I imagined a real-life conversation : 
If I want to know any recipe I will of course greet her first.
Then I will tell her that I want the pasta recipe and she will tell me the recipe.
If she doesn't know any recipe, she obviously tell me that she doesn't know the recipe.

## My Approach

I first greeted the user by simple 'print' statement, and then I asked user which recipe he/she wanted ?
If user asks about pasta recipe, then it should tell the recipe by using if-else condition.
And if user asks about other than pasta then it will say, "Recipe is not available."
Right now, I only included pasta recipe and I will add more recipes later using list and dictionaries.
I also used time.sleep(), so the conversation feels real.

## Future Improvements 

I will further add more recipes using dictionary and lists.
